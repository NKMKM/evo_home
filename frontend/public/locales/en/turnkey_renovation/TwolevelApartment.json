        "h": "COMFORTABLE LAYOUT",
        "p": "In a traditional duplex layout, the first floor is usually reserved for shared living spaces such as the kitchen, dining area, living room, storage room, and bathroom, while the upper floor hosts private rooms such as the master bedroom, office, children‚Äôs room, and an additional bathroom. This configuration promotes a clear separation of functional zones."
      },
      "2": {
        "h": "TERRACE LAYOUT",
        "p": "An alternative option involves reversing the floor distribution so that the terrace is located on the upper level. In this case, bedrooms and private areas are placed on the lower floor, while the kitchen, living room, and other communal zones are on the upper floor‚Äîproviding direct access to the terrace."
      },
      "3": {
        "h": "STAIRCASE POSITIONING",
        "p": "The staircase, a key element connecting the two levels, must be carefully designed to ensure both functionality and aesthetic harmony. Depending on the available space and personal preferences, you can choose between a spiral staircase, which saves space, and a traditional staircase with multiple flights."
      },
      "4": {
        "h": "VENTILATION AND COMFORT",
        "p": "Designing an efficient ventilation system is essential in duplex apartments, where air circulation must be optimized to prevent overheating of the upper level. At EvoHome, we use advanced technologies to ensure a comfortable indoor climate throughout the year."
